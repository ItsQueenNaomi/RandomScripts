To compile this program, ensure you have all required libraries installed. (Although, most are standard)


Execute the following shell commands in the directory of the script:

g++ -std=c++20 -o ./shred ./shred.cpp

If this throws an error, you can try:

g++ -std=c++20 -o ./shred ./shred.cpp -lstdc++fs

Otherwise, it may be beneficial to consult ChatGPT with a similar prompt:
  Can you please correct this c++ compilation error "
    $g++ -std=c++20 -o ./shred ./shred.cpp -lstdc++fs
    ERROR: ---
    ERROR: ---
" (replace with your command and its output)

Then, follow its instructions to hopefully rectify the situation.

Happy Shredding!
